I am a **Senior Software/Data Engineer** passionate about transforming data chaos into structured, scalable, and automated platforms.

Throughout my career, I have evolved from advanced research in European Big Data and AI projects to leading critical architectures within the insurance sector. Currently, I serve as the **Lead Developer** for a major corporate integrated data platform, designing and managing complex ecosystems in multi-cloud environments (**Azure and AWS**). My daily work involves:

* **Orchestrating** pipelines with Apache Airflow.
* **Scaling** infrastructure on Kubernetes.
* **Ensuring** continuous delivery through GitOps with ArgoCD.

I firmly believe that cloud provider portals are great for learning, but **Terraform** is the essential tool for production. My approach focuses on eliminating manual processes and the risk of human error through **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**, turning deployments that once took entire afternoons into flawless processes completed in just a couple of minutes.
